# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### TODO and improvement

- unit tests of react components and redux
- typeahead functionality for search input - (need to consider the quick backspace action)
- list drop down option for year range selection (nice to have)
- empty state component
- error state component
